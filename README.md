# SimPYson: A Pythonic Interface for SIMPSON

SimPYson combines the power of SIMPSON NMR simulations with the versatility of Python, providing a seamless and efficient way to interact with SIMPSON within your Python workflows. Currently, the code is in its embryonic stage.

# Current Implementation:

- Read data from SIMPSON spectra: Read and manipulate NMR data from SIMPSON `spe`, `fid` and `xreim` files directly into Python, enabling further analysis and processing.

More information can be found in the [documentation](https://carlosbornes.github.io/simpyson/).

# Planned Features:

- DFT Data Parsing: Seamlessly parse and extract relevant data from DFT calculations into SIMPSON.

- Spinsys Preparation: Automate the process of preparing SIMPSON spinsys files from extracted DFT data.

- SIMPSON Input File Generation: Generate SIMPSON input files from prepared spinsys files, saving time and effort in setting up your simulations.

- Output File Analysis: Extract and analyze NMR data from SIMPSON output files, facilitating further data processing and exploration.
