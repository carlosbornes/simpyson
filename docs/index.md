`SimPYson` is a Python package developed to simplify the use of [SIMPSON](https://inano.au.dk/about/research-centers-and-projects/nmr/software/simpson), a simulation software for solid-state NMR. Born out of the frustration of trying to learn and use SIMPSON on my own, SimPYson aims to streamline the process by converting results from DFT calculations into SIMPSON input files and reading output files from SIMPSON simulations.

Currently, the package can:
- Convert results from DFT calculations (e.g., CASTEP, Quantum Espresso, VASP) into SIMPSON input files.
- Read and process output files from SIMPSON simulations.
- Provide ready-to-use templates for common SIMPSON NMR experiments, such as 90-degree pulse and no-pulse.
